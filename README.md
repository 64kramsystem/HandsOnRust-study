# "Hands-on Rust Source Code" Study fork

This is my study fork of of Hands-on Rust Source Code. The original [codebase](https://github.com/thebracket/HandsOnRust) is a bit dirty and inconvenient to systematically read.

This fork:

- adds a Visual Studio Code launch configuration;
- renames all the directories to be in order, so that each directory can be very conveniently found an compared agains the predecessor/successor;
- cleans up a big bunch of warnings.

Some chapters don't have the warnings fully cleaned up (only automated fixes), as I've started fully cleaning up after I had already completed a few chapters.

There are also a couple of scripts I've used in order to perform a part of the changes.

## Status

As of 27/Mar/2022, I'm halfway through the book, so some further cleanups will be applied (to warnings).
