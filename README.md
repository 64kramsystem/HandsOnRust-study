# "Hands-on Rust Source Code" Study fork

This is my study fork of of Hands-on Rust Source Code, which makes the original [codebase](https://github.com/thebracket/HandsOnRust) simpler to study:

- added a Visual Studio Code launch configuration;
- renamed all the directories to be in order, so that each one can be very conveniently found an compared agains the predecessor/successor;
- removed the comment references (`// (<n>`) for ease of comparison;
- fixed warnings that could be automatedley fixed (via `cargo fix`).

There are also a couple of scripts I've used to perform a part of the changes.
